- Local DHCP, DNS.

#  Installation

## Prerequisites:
 - PC or laptop with Linux, Windows with [WSL](https://ubuntu.com/wsl) or MacOS operating system installed.
 - A Raspberry Pi model 4 with a wired TCP connection to LAN.
 - A Micro SD-card class 10 > 8GB 
 - Git installed.
 - Ansible 2.10 > installed.
 - [ssh_askpass](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=ssh-askpass) installed.
 - [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)  installed.
 - [Raspberry Pi OS Lite 64 bits image , Release date: September 6th 2022.](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_arm64/images/raspios_lite_arm64-2022-09-07/2022-09-06-raspios-bullseye-arm64-lite.img.xz) 
 - Ansible vault password ( contact DEAN development)
 
## Install Raspberry Pi OS

 - Use Raspberry PI Imager to write the downloaded image to the SD-card using instructions at  https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#installing-the-operating-system.
 - Insert the SD-card.
 - Start Raspberry PI Imager.
 - Under **Operating system** select **Choose OS --> Use Custom** and select the downloaded image -   [Raspberry Pi OS Lite 64 bits image , Release date: May 3rd 2023.](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_arm64/images/raspios_lite_arm64-2023-05-03/2023-05-03-raspios-bullseye-arm64-lite.img.xz)
 - Under **Storage** and select the SD-card device.
 - Select **Advanced options** -->  **Enable SSH** --> **Use password authentication**. 
 - Set **Username** to: **pi** and **Password** to : **elimupi** and select **SAVE**.
 - Select **WRITE**.
  
 When the image has been successfully written insert the SD-card into the Raspberry Pi and boot the device connected to local LAN.

## Build ElimuPi Image

Provision the ElimuPi software by running the ansible-play book against local Raspberry Pi and build Elimupi the image.

 - Find the Pi's assigned IP address on your local LAN. ( via Wifi router or a nmap).
 - Git clone this repo and cd elimupi/ansible directory of this repo.
 - Adjust the current IP adresss of key : ansible_host  in file  inventory.yml to your Pi's local assigned IP address. 
 - Increment version release number variable, **elimupi_release**: in file ansible/group_vars/all/vars.yml if needed.
 - Install Ansible collections:

`ansible-galaxy collection install -r collections.yml`

 - Install Ansible roles.

`ansible-galaxy install -r roles.yml`

 - Run playbook

`ansible-playbook -i ./inventory.yml playbook-raspberrypi.yml --ask-vault-pass`

The installation will take approximately 20 minutes to finish and there shouldn't be any errors.

## Create ElimuPi image copy 

 - Create a image copy of the SD-card with the ElimuPi software installed using instructions at https://beebom.com/how-clone-raspberry-pi-sd-card-windows-linux-macos/
 -  Shrink cloned the image file ( Linux Only) using [PiShrink](https://github.com/Drewsif/PiShrink) and the compression option -Za 
 - Name the image: **ElimuPi_Image_2023-05-03-raspios-bullseye-arm64_lite_Release_<-Version->.img.xz** e.g

This should produce a xz compressed Elimupi image file.

The image file can than be directly written to other SD-cards using Raspberry Pi Imager selecting the image with Use Custom Operation System option. 

# Connecting to Elimupi

-  Disconnect the Raspberry PI's TCP wired connection.
-  Connect your device via WiFi to SSID:  **elimu** using passcode: **1234567890**
